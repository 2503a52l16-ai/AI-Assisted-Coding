Reflection â€“ Automated vs Manual Documentation

Automated documentation helps keep the project consistent with the codebase.
It ensures that developers do not need to manually rewrite usage guides or
API references every time code changes. This saves time and reduces errors.

In real-world projects, automated documentation:
- Improves maintainability.
- Ensures that documentation stays up-to-date.
- Helps new developers onboard quickly.
- Reduces duplication of effort.

Manual documentation, however, is still important for context, design decisions,
and explanations that automated tools cannot capture.

Best practice: Use both automated tools (for code and API docs) and manual
notes (for context and design) together.
